# topology

A library for interacting with the data structures that arose in the course of my topology research with Bena Tshishiku (summer 2020). I went back and cleaned it up a tiny bit, but I probably wouldn't endorse writing Python the way I did back then. I left in all my unfinished tinkering as comments.
